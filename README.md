### Eye Tracking Experiment

The code will generate patches of dots in 9 random positions (3 x 3 grid). 
In one full run, the dots will go to each position once (after first 9 trials, the dot should visit all those 9 positions)
The participant should stare at the center and press left or right to indicate how they feel the dots are moving.
